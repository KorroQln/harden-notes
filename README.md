Ubuntu Security Guide (USG)

- https://ubuntu.com/blog/cis-security-compliance-usg
- Can also create a custom profile based on CIS
- recomended to run on test/dev env instead of prod env
- Only available in Pro??
	

With Ubuntu Security Guide
- you can customize (tailor) the CIS profile; select the CIS rules to comply with.
- you can select a specific version of the CIS benchmark, i.e., a tooling upgrade doesnâ€™t need to break scheduled scans that target a specific benchmark version.
- teams can standardize on a profile by storing it in a hard-wired location, preventing the case of different people accidentally scanning or complying with different profiles or versions.
- the same experience applies whether scanning for the CIS benchmark, DISA-STIG and any other profiles made available in the future.
- last but not least, you use a consistent interface across Ubuntu releases.
